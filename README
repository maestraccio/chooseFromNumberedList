**chooseFromNumberedList** allows you to print and select from items in a given
list by entering the number or moving the selector up and down with the plus
and minus signs, or with brackets pointing left (backward) or right (forward),
also multiple of those in one input.
The function requires one list of (min) four to (max) eight elements:
the NumberedList:    the given [list, with, the, items] to choose from
the Sorting Method:  "A" = Ascending, "D" = Descending, "R" = Random (LOL)
the Starting Number: common are 0 or 1, but any positive number can be given
the Default Option:  a number in the numbering list, between the lowest and
                     the highest number in the list (inclusive)
Optional1 (string):  a customized indicator: Can contain a colour code
                     (don't forget to close it with "\033[0m"!). Default
                     string length is 3, but you can also change the length
                     to make it stand out. If it is "O", the first three
                     characters of the chosen key are used.
Optional2 (list):    A list with valid options that are not shown in the
                     NumberedList - recommended for repeating exit options.
                     ATTENTION: It returns only the chosen option, twice!
Optional3 (integer): 0: move the indicator to the chosen position and wait for
                        the next input, accept only on "Enter" (except for
                        options in the optional "HiddenList", which are always
                        immediately accepted).
                     1: immediately accept the input if the input is a valid
                        option (default if omitted)
Optional4 (boolean): True:  MultipleChoice: Create a list of chosen items. 
                            Items can be added in one comma separated input, 
                            or one-by-one, or both.
                     False: Accept only one choice. This is the default.
It returns the selected item in the list and its index number in that list,
unless MultipleChoice is True. In that case two lists, one with items and the
other with indexes, are returned.

**chooseFromKeysList** allows you to print and select from items in a given list
by entering the key or moving the selector up and down with the plus and minus

The function requires one list of (min) four to (max) seven elements:
the NotNumberedList: the given [list, with, the, items] to choose from

                     lists MUST be equal in length
the Case:            "U"pper, "l"ower or "C"ase sensitive
the Default Choice:  The the default option key in the KeysList
Optional1 (string):  a customized indicator: Can contain a colour code
                     (don't forget to close it with "\033[0m"!). Default

                     to make it stand out. If it is "O", the first three

Optional3 (integer): 0: move the indicator to the chosen position and wait for
                        the next input, accept only on "Enter" (except for
                        options in the optional "HiddenList", which are always
                        immediately accepted).
