the Default Option:  a number in the numbering list, between the lowest and
                     the highest number in the list (inclusive)
Optional:            a customized indicator: Can contain a colour code (don't
                     forget to close it with "\033[0m"!). Default string length
                     is 3, but you can also change the length to make it stand
                     out.
